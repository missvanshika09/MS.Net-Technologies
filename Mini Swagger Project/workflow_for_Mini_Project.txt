/* Algorithm to Understand and Use the Code */
-----------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Overview of the Code
Purpose:

Build a Web API for managing members using CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Integrate Swagger for generating API documentation.
Components:

IMembers.cs: Interface defining methods for CRUD operations.
MembersRepository.cs: Implementation of the IMembers interface, simulating a database.
MemberController.cs: API controller handling HTTP requests and routing.
Members.cs: Model class representing a "Member" entity.
Program.cs: Configures the application, dependency injection, and Swagger.
WebAPI.Controllers.csproj: Project file including the Swagger package.
Step 2: How the Components Work Together
IMembers.cs:

Acts as a contract, defining CRUD operations: GetAllMember, GetMember, Add, Update, and Delete.
MembersRepository.cs:

Implements IMembers and provides the logic for managing a static list of Members.
Members.cs:

Defines the Members class with properties like MemberId, FirstName, LastName, and Address.
MemberController.cs:

Defines API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for handling member data.
Invokes methods from MembersRepository via IMembers.
Program.cs:

Configures services and middleware for the Web API, including Swagger.
Swagger:

Generates an interactive API documentation page.
Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Set Up the Environment
Install .NET SDK (8.0 or higher) on your system.
Create a new directory and initialize a Web API project:
bash
Copy code
dotnet new webapi -n WebAPI.Controllers
Add Swagger dependencies to the project:
bash
Copy code
dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore --version 6.4.0
Step 2: Code Implementation
Replace or add files to the project as per the provided code structure:

IMembers.cs
MembersRepository.cs
MemberController.cs
Members.cs
Program.cs
WebAPI.Controllers.csproj
Ensure all namespaces match the file structure (WebAPI.Controllers).

Step 3: Understand Dependency Injection
The IMembers interface is registered in Program.cs:
csharp
Copy code
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMembers, MembersRepository>();
At runtime, the framework injects MembersRepository wherever IMembers is used (e.g., in MemberController).
Step 4: Enable Swagger
Swagger is configured in Program.cs:
csharp
Copy code
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();
app.UseSwagger();
app.UseSwaggerUI();
Access Swagger UI by running the application and navigating to http://localhost:<port>/swagger.
Step 5: Test the API
Run the application:
bash
Copy code
dotnet run
Use Swagger to interact with the endpoints:
GET /api/Member: Fetch all members.
GET /api/Member/{id}: Fetch a specific member.
POST /api/Member: Add a new member.
PUT /api/Member/{id}: Update a member.
DELETE /api/Member/{id}: Delete a member.
Step 6: Push Code to GitHub
Initialize a GitHub repository:

bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
git push -u origin main
Document usage in the README.md:

Include instructions for setup, running, and testing the API.
Mention Swagger documentation.
Sample User Guide for Understanding Swagger Integration
What is Swagger?

Swagger is a tool that provides an interactive UI for testing and documenting RESTful APIs.
It simplifies API testing by auto-generating the API structure based on your code.
How to Access Swagger in This Project:

Run the project and navigate to http://localhost:<port>/swagger.
Explore endpoints for members (e.g., GET, POST, etc.).
Testing Endpoints:

Use Swagger to send HTTP requests with sample data and view responses.
Advantages of This Approach
Separation of Concerns:

Business logic (MembersRepository) is separate from controllers (MemberController).
Scalability:

Interfaces (IMembers) allow easy swapping of data sources (e.g., replace static list with a database).
Swagger Integration:

Automatically updates documentation as endpoints are modified.
